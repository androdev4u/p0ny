My Little P0ny

The My Little P0ny prank utilizes a freely available sleep function that is part of the Microsoft 2003 resource toolkit.  In order to utilize this, you must download the file.  Use your search engine of choice and download sleep.exe.

In addition, the image must be in bitmap format.  In order for it to function without modification name the file winter.bmp.  Make sure the file is a BMP file not just a BMP extension.

Place the downloaded files in the following directory structure:

Root dir
install.vbs
MLP_uninstall.bat
mlp.bat
MLP (folder)

Inside the MLP folder place the following files:
little.bat
my.vbs
ponies.bat
readme.txt
sleep.exe
winter.bmp
