Sick of your computer desktop background setting to my little pony?

Next time you should remember to lock your desktop so this doesn't happen.

In the matter of 3 seconds someone was able to install a small program that sets your desktop background to my little pony. This isn't malicious in nature but imagine what someone that wanted to do something malicious could do.  The code to do what we did took roughly an hour to write and get working.

There is an uninstall script located in C:\Temp

double click on the MLP_uninstall.bat file.  A command prompt window will pop up and remove all changes we made to the system.
